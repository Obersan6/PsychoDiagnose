Intellectual disability begins in the developmental period (before 18 years old).\n\n• Communication disorders: These involve difficulties in language or speech, but intellectual functioning (reasoning, problem-solving) is normal.\n\n• Autism spectrum disorder (ASD): While ASD can co-occur with intellectual disability, the hallmark is social communication deficits and restricted/repetitive behaviors. Intellectual disability does not inherently include these traits.\n\n• Specific learning disorder: Affects skills like reading or math but does not include deficits in general intellectual functioning or adaptive skills."
